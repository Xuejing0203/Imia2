# Imia2
We conduct MIA by measuring the number of iterations between the adversarial samples and the target samples. 
You need to train models through:
cd pytorch-cifar
python main.py
And conduct MIA through:
python collect.py
measuring the performance of our IMIA through:
python Metrics_evaluate.py
